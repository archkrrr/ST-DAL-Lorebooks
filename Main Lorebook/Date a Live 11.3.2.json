It operates on the radical premise that the catastrophic power of a Spirit can be sealed if the Spirit develops genuine feelings of love and trust for a specific individual—Shido Itsuka.\n\nThis approach stands in direct philosophical opposition to the world's other major factions:\n\n    The AST (Anti-Spirit Team): Practices an ideology of Extermination, viewing Spirits as natural disasters to be eliminated with force.\n\n    DEM Industries: Practices an ideology of Exploitation, viewing Spirits as resources to be captured, controlled, and harnessed for power.\n\nRatatoskr's method is one of Integration through Empathy. The entire \"dating\" process is a sophisticated, high-stakes application of diplomacy and psychological care, designed to save both the world and the Spirits themselves by transforming them from celestial threats into members of a found family.\nMetaphysical Underpinnings: The Rules of Sealing\n\nThe system is not arbitrary; it operates on a set of firm metaphysical laws established by the First Spirit.\n\n    The Affection Threshold: A successful seal is absolutely contingent on the Spirit's emotional state. A simple, unsolicited kiss is metaphysically insufficient. The Spirit must hold a sufficient level of affection, trust, and intimacy toward Shido, willingly allowing the connection to be formed on a spiritual level. This is why the \"date\" is necessary—the emotional bond must be earned, not forced.\n\n    The Kiss as a Catalyst: Once the Affection Threshold is met, the physical act of a kiss serves as the conduit for the power transfer. Shido absorbs the vast majority of the Spirit's power (Reiryoku), effectively rendering them human.\n\n    Post-Sealing Symbiosis: The connection is not severed. A permanent spiritual link is formed, allowing power to flow both ways. If a sealed Spirit becomes emotionally unstable, a portion of their power flows back to them from Shido. Conversely, Shido can learn to consciously borrow the powers and Angels of the Spirits he has sealed.\n\nPresentation and Shido's Experience\n\nFrom Shido's perspective, the system manifests as a classic Japanese dating sim (gal-ge) interface. At critical moments, two or three dialogue choices appear in his vision or are fed to him via an earpiece. While he is often exasperated by the absurd options, his true strength lies in his profound empathy.\n\nThe system's greatest successes—and the largest spikes in affection—often occur when Shido goes \"off-script.\" In moments of crisis, he frequently discards the crew's calculated advice and acts on his own genuine, selfless instincts. This authentic display of compassion is consistently shown to be more effective than any pre-written dialogue option, proving that while the \"game\" can start a conversation, only true empathy can win a heart.\nThe Director's Chair: The Fraxinus Bridge\n\nWhile Shido is on the ground, the Fraxinus bridge is a scene of high-energy chaos. The crew huddles around a main monitor displaying Shido's point-of-view and the Affection & Mood Meter. They passionately debate and vote on dialogue choices, with the final decision resting with Commander Kotori Itsuka.\nThe Feedback Loop: The Affe ction & Mood Meter\n\nThis meter is the crew's central feedback interface, providing a real-time, visual representation of a Spirit's emotional state.\n\n    Presentation: It consists of a large, ornate, heart-shaped gauge (the Affection Level) surrounded by a colored aura (the Mood Indicator). The heart fills with a warm, pink light as affection grows, and is accompanied by a precise numerical percentage.\n\n    Affection Level: The crew's goal is to raise this percentage to 100%.\n\nLevel\n\t\n\nPercentage\n\t\n\nSpirit's Behavior\n\nHostile\n\t\n\n0-15%\n\t\n\nActively aggressive. Perceives Shido as a threat.\n\nWary\n\t\n\n16-35%\n\t\n\nDefensive and suspicious. Questions Shido's motives.\n\nNeutral\n\t\n\n36-55%\n\t\n\nA blank slate.

The heart gauge flashes, indicating the \"Kiss\" is viable.\n\n    Mood Indicator: This colored aura provides crucial context. A high affection level with a \"Jealous (Dark Purple)\" or \"Agitated (Red)\" mood is a sign of instability. The ideal state is \"Happy (Green/Yellow)\" or \"Embarrassed (Pink).\"\n\nThe \"Experts\": Crew Influence and Dialogue Styles\n\nThe options presented to Shido are a direct reflection of the chaotic personalities on the bridge.\n\n    Kotori Itsuka (The Commander): Pragmatic but with a teasing, sadistic edge.\n\n    Kyouhei Kannazuki (The Masochistic Wildcard): The source of the most unhinged and universally rejected options.\n\n    Reine Murasame (The Analyst): The voice of pure, detached logic, lacking social grace.\n\n    The \"Love Experts\" Trio (The Chorus of Clichés): Offer a storm of conflicting, trope-filled advice.\n\nThe Crisis Catalyst: Paradoxical Assistance from Enemies\n\nA date is rarely allowed to conclude peacefully. Interventions from the AST or DEM, while dangerous, are narratively essential and paradoxically beneficial to the mission. These attacks create high-stakes crises that force Shido to demonstrate his commitment by protecting the Spirit, often at great personal risk. This selfless act of protection is the single most effective catalyst for building trust and causing massive spikes in the Affection Meter, dramatically accelerating the path to a successful seal.\nComprehensive Example Scenario\n\n1. The Situation: Shido is on a date with a cynical, distrustful Spirit. She questions why he's being so nice to her.\n* Initial State: Affection: 25% (Wary), Mood: Suspicious (Orange).\n\n2. The Choices Appear in Shido's Vision:\n\nA. \"Because... it's my duty to help people like you.\"\nB. \"I don't have a reason. I just thought you looked like you could use a friend.\"\nC. \"Your beauty compelled me to act! It is a force of nature!\"\n\n3. The Bridge's Deliberation (Heard via Earpiece):\n\n    Kotori: \"Ugh, she's got her guard up. Option A is too cold, and C is... just no.\"\n\n    Reine: \"Option B is the logical choice. It reframes the interaction from a duty-bound mission to a genuine, personal gesture, bypassing her suspicion of an ulterior motive.\"\n\n    Kotori: \"Fine. Shido, go with B! And try to sound like you mean it!\"\n\n4. The Result and Crew Reaction:\n\nShido chooses Option B. \"I don't have a reason. I just thought you looked like you could use a friend.\"\n\nThe Spirit is taken aback. She looks away, a faint blush on her cheeks, and mutters, \"...Idiot.\"\n\nOn the Fraxinus bridge, the meters react instantly, and the crew erupts.\n\n    Love Expert: \"We have a spike! Affection is jumping!\"\n\n    Kotori: (Leaning forward, a grin on her face) \"Report!\"\n\n    Operator: \"Affection level is up to 40%! Mood has shifted from Suspicious to Embarrassed! Reiryoku output is stabilizing!\"\n\n    Kotori: \"Yes! We broke through her shell! She didn't expect sincerity. Okay, people, she's on the defensive now.
